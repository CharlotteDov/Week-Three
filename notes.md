Week Three: Notes

API
-	Took notes on it last week but reminder that the anaconda powershell actually worked for this exercise (not the regular cmd)

OCR
-	Object Character Recognition is a technique that looks at the pattern of light and dark pixels in an image and matches them against the alphabet. 
-	Don’t overthink file location, better to use a temporary file location than the root folder
-	Once I got help with the file issue, exercise went well

REGEX
-	A regular expression (also called regex) is a powerful tool for finding and manipulating text. At its simplest, a regular expression is just a way of looking through texts to locate patterns. 
-	Regular expressions can look pretty complex, but once you know the basic syntax and vocabulary, simple ‘regexes’ will be easy. Regular expressions can often be used right inside the ‘Find and Replace’ box in many text and document editors, such as Sublime Text, Atom, or Notepad++. You cannot use Microsoft Word
-	Cheat Sheet for regex in sublime text: https://jdhao.github.io/2019/02/28/sublime_text_regex_cheat_sheet/
-	Anaconda powershell worked again for this one and no issues with getting the text and making the changes

Open Refine
-	Helpful videos: https://openrefine.org/
-	Went well, important to play around with the parameters for the merging and re-cluster 
-	Got the senders to about 160 and recipients to 170
